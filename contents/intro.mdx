I am currently a junior at **University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**, majoring in Computer Science.

Outside of school, I am also a full-stack developer. I found myself passionate about learning new web technologies and solving problems. During my free time, I would work on some [projects](/projects) either for fun with friends or to solve my current problems.

Moreover, I am also a **TypeScript React** and **GraphQL** enthusiast. Most of my projects involve both of them. I think they are interesting to learn and have great ecosystems.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jxianc), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jingxianchai) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jingxianchai).
