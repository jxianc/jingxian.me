I am currently a junior at **University of Minnesota, Twin Cities**, majoring in Computer Science.

Besides school, I am also a full-stack developer. I found myself passionate about learning new web technologies and solving problems. During my free time, I like to work on some [projects](/projects) either for fun with friends or to solve my current problems.

Other than that, I am also a **TypeScript React** and **GraphQL** enthusiast. Most of my projects involve both of them. I think they are interesting to learn and have great ecosystems.
