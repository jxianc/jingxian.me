A simple web application to show the current real-time metro transit schedules using a third-party API.

I have been taking the light rail to commute to my classes every day. What bothers me is that I have to wait about 10 minutes, sometimes even 20 minutes, when it leaves right in front of my eyes. This situation gets worse during the winter, especially in Minneapolis. I created this web application to show the real-time schedule of the light rail so that I donâ€™t have to wait at the station and suffer the cold.
