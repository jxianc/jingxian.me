Just two regular college students who like to play **Minesweeper** during their free time trying to make their own **Minesweeper** game to learn new things like web technologies and algorithms.

What I learned from this project is the usage of several services of **Firebase** like **Authentication**, **Cloud Functions**, **Hosting**, and **Cloud Firestore**. We implemented a **breadth-first search** algorithm in one of the game logic to clear out the safe blocks around the user clicked block.
